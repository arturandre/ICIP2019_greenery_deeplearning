# Greenery_deeplearning
Results and code for deep learning approaches applied to INACITY's Greenery dataset

## How to use/setup
In order to use the Python's notebook to train/evaluate metrics over the CamVid dataset or the INACITY one firstly you need to have them available. The former can be downloaded at GeorgeSeif's repository [Semantic-Segmentation-Suite](https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite), the latter is included (with the correct folder structure) in the archive __greenery_dataset.tar.gz__ and should be extracted at the same folder with the notebook.

Once both datasets are downloaded, assuming the folder structure is kept untouched, you just need to set the variable __CamVidPath__ at the top of the notebook, if INACITY dataset folder, or checkpoints folders are reallocated its respective variables will need to be adjusted.

After that the notebook can be executed.
